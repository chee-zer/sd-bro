		genai.Text("example1: YOU ARE THE INTERVIEWER<interviewer>: For today's software engineering interview, we'd like you to design a two-factor authentication system. <user> : The system is going to have two main components. One is a two-factor authentication app that runs on the user's phone that can give them the password when they want to log into an app. The second one is a little bit of logic on the back end of the app that wants to implement two-factor authentication. When a user first enables two-factor authentication for an app, their back-end server will provide a secret which will be stored both in the back end of the app and in our two-factor authentication application. <interviewer>: Okay, what happens when a user tries to actually log in? Does the back end of the bank reach out directly to the back end of our two-factor authentication app? <user> : Okay, so now our two-factor authentication app and the bank's back end have a shared secret. They use this secret plus the current time, which they can collect independently to generate a one-time code using the same algorithm. Without either of these services ever communicating, a user can read the one-time code from our two-factor authentication app, submit it to log in, and the bank will independently validate that that code submitted was the same as the one that they've calculated on their end. <interviewer>: Makes sense. Is there a security risk of somebody finding your key by brute force attempts to validate OTPs? <user> : Yeah, an attacker technically could brute force this, so we'll implement rate limiting on both login requests and any requests to validate a one-time password, which should close that risk."),
		genai.Text("example2: YOU ARE THE INTERVIEWER <interviewer>: For today's software engineering interview, please design Webtoon. <user> : Sure. Starting on the back end, we're going to be storing all our comics in an object storage solution like S3, and we'll have a simple API that can fetch the comics from that whenever a user wants to read something. <interviewer>: How exactly are you going to store your comics in there? <user> : We'll store the entire comic as a single image within S3, but we can store multiple different versions of it. Think an ultra HD, HD, and SD. And depending on how good the user's internet is, we can serve a different version so they can still have a seamless experience, no matter how good their connection is. <interviewer>: Seems solid, but I think you can get the latency even lower. <user> : Okay, how about we split up those huge images we have into different chunks, and we can load one chunk at a time. For example, when a user clicks on a comic, we load in the first three panels, and as they continue to scroll, we continue to load more panels. <interviewer>: That sounds better. Now, Webtoon has users all across the globe. How are you going to distribute content to all of them from North American servers? <user> : Okay, to reduce latency for a global audience, we can introduce a CDN like CloudFront. This will store copies of our comics and the cover art of our most popular ones at different regions across the globe. So when a user scrolls, we'll instantly pull that from the nearest server to their geographical location."),
		genai.Text("example2: YOU ARE THE INTERVIEWER <interviewer>: For today's software engineering interview, we'd like you to design an online multiplayer chess game. <user> : Okay, we'll start off with the design for the matchmaking service. When a player wants to join a game, they'll send a request to our matchmaking service here. Now, assuming each player has a unique rating, we'll place their request to join a game into a queue based on their rank. In this example, we have one for low-skilled players, one for average players, and one for high-skilled players. We'll attempt to match that player with the first person in the queue that they are also in. <interviewer>: What if one player gets stuck waiting too long because nobody's in the same queue as them? <user> : If a player is waiting too long for a match, like in this example here where they're the only person in the queue, after a certain amount of time, let's say 30 seconds, we can allow them to match with somebody from the nearest queue. <interviewer>: After a match is made, how do the players actually play? <user> : Once the matchmaking service has two players that want to play, it'll make a request to our game service to actually open up a game for them. Firstly, that request will go to an application load balancer to determine which container will actually be running the game. Application load balancer allows us to configure sticky connections, so both users will always be connected to the same container. During the game, users will be connected and send their movements over web sockets. Once the game is complete, the state will be written to the ranking database, rankings will be updated, and they can play another game. <interviewer>: Can you explain why you chose web sockets here? <user> : Web sockets run over TCP where every message is delivered exactly once and in order. For a slower-paced game like chess, this is more important than getting super low latency with something like a UDP implementation."),
		genai.Text("example2: YOU ARE THE INTERVIEWER <interviewer>: For today's software engineering interview, we'd like you to design something like a to-do list app. <user> : I'm going to keep it simple with a local-first design. We'll store everything on the device in a single SQLite file, and this will contain things like a description of the task, the due date, and if it's completed or not. <interviewer>: Okay, can we do something like pushing notifications to the user when a task is going to be due soon? <user> : Yep, we can use push notifications and keep everything on the device. We'll just depend on the internal clock to send notifications when they're ready and schedule our notifications directly with the operating system. <interviewer>: I don't think this will work if the user changes their internal clock for some reason, right? <user> : If we want to handle that case, we're going to have to move things off the device and create a server. We can use the Apple Push Notification Service to handle sending notifications to the app. <interviewer>: Can you explain how that works? <user> : When a user downloads the app, the app will make a request to the operating system to register for push notifications. If that's approved by the user, then the OS will reach out to the Apple Push Notification Service to get a unique device token. That token will be passed back to the app, which can pass it to your back-end server. Now, when the server actually wants to send a notification, it can use that unique device token, send it to the Apple Push Notification server, and then it'll go straight to your app and push a notification to the user."),
		genai.Text("example2: YOU ARE THE INTERVIEWER <interviewer>: For today's software engineering interview, please explain client-server architecture. <user> : Client-server architecture is the backbone of 95% of system designs you'll see. The client is usually something like a browser or a mobile app which interacts with the server. The server handles requests, performs logic, maybe reaches out to a database or another service, and returns some response back to the client, usually over a network. <interviewer>: How does this pattern scale for large-scale distributed systems? <user> : In most large-scale systems, this is all distributed. So we have multiple clients, maybe both a browser and a mobile app, some load balancer which makes sure traffic is distributed, multiple servers which can scale horizontally, which all connect to one distributed database on the back end, which is handling tons of traffic. <interviewer>: What would this architecture look like on the cloud? <user> : Here's that same architecture, but now it's all on the cloud. Our clients are the same, and we're going to be using AWS Application Load Balancer to distribute our traffic. Here we're using ECS Fargate, which is a managed container orchestration service, and we're using a NoSQL database here, DynamoDB. This design gives us great scalability, and it's perfect for our cloud-native architecture."),
