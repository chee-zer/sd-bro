# SD Mate

SD Mate is an AI Assistant which makes system design articles into a friendly discussion session. It asks you questions and nudges you towards the solution within the selected duration of the discussion. Think of it as having a personal system design tutor who asks insightful questions, offers gentle nudges, and provides helpful hints, guiding you towards understanding complex solutions. It uses the Gemini API. This project was made for the [BootDev](https://boot.dev) Hackathon 2025.

### Features
- get an interview type discussion of any blog you find interesting.
- The quality and difficulty of the questions will be tailored to your chosen session length(i.e, 5 minutes - Fast pace, high-level overview, advanced concepts, direct questions, concise hints. whereas for 15 minutes - Thorough pace, ground-up exploration, detailed questions, comprehensive hints.)
- Audio mode, to simulate the experience of a live interview, improving your verbal communication skills under pressure.
- Curated list of articles to choose from.

### why would you use it: 
This is mainly for learning purposes, but you can definitely practice and revise concepts for actual interviews.

### vision:
An go to learning platform for system design, so that instead of reading blogs and forgetting them later, you can retain concepts much better. I also want to store a large amount of system design articles solving various problems, so that the user won't have to search for articles everytime.

### future:
Will be redoing this project with a lot better backend. Also plan to make it a mobile app.
